[b][u]ATTENTION! Update 5 is the first, rather crude update for the mod to work with HOI v1.3.1. All factions should be disabled but no modifications to are yet made to the new features added in 1.3. This means some of those features, like tech bonuses, are non-functional![/b][/u]

This mod removes all starting factions and the abilities to create new ones.

National focuses and events that create factions or invite countries to factions can still trigger if prerequisites are met but no factions are formed.

No balance work has been done yet, and AI might break or do silly things because there are no factions.
